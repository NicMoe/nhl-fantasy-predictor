# nhl-fantasy-predictor
Gearing up for the 2019-20 NHL season, this is a project to learn how to create player and team predictions using real-time data.

Steps for this project:
1. Understand NHL fantasy scoring system(s) to determine target outcomes variables.
2. Get some relevant game stats by player per game for past few seasons.
3. Determine predictive modeling process.
4. Find way to regularly (daily?) scrape player stats by game.
5. Re-run model with updated data (daily?), and output recommendations.
